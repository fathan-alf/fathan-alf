# Hi, I'm Fathan 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer with 4 years of experience in building functional and user-friendly web applications. I'm passionate about creating clean, scalable solutions that empower communities and solving real-world problems through technology. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Next.js, React.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL.

My background in Software Engineering during high school and my current studies in Informatics Engineering at Universitas Negeri Malang have shaped my strong foundation in software development. Over the years, I’ve built projects ranging from office management systems to digital platforms for SMEs and community services.

Recently, I’ve been expanding my skills in project management and data science to broaden both my technical and strategic perspectives as a developer.
